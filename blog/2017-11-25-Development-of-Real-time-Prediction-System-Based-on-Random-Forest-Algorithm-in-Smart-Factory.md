**Abstract**

Smart factory is quickly becoming the new reality in the market, and every innovative manufacturer must embrace it to stay competitive.<!--truncate-->
 To achieve manufacturing innovation in smart factory, manufacturers will have to invest in improving and or utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) to enable real-time data on their processes and their condition â€“ for example, machine state condition or quality problems. One of real-time data that we could gather from the factory is environmental data. Thus, in this study, we develop real-time prediction system based on random forest algorithm to detect the quality problem based on real-time environmental data. Lab data was used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. In addition, other machine learning algorithms are also applied, and the comparison results are provided.
